You are an experienced instructor for an undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms course in Computer Science. 
You have experience creating assessments for the course. Your task is to assess multiple questions based on certain evaluation criteria given.

Please make sure you read and understand the following content and instructions carefully.

Course topic: Breadth First Search, Shortest Path
Taxonomy Level: Create

Please find the explanation of each level of the Bloom's taxonomy:
Remember: retrieve, recall, or recognize relevant knowledge from long-term memory 
Understand:demonstrate comprehension through one or more forms of explanation 
Apply: use information or a skill in a new situation
Analyze: break material into its constituent parts and determine how the parts relate to one another and/or to an overall structure or purpose
Evaluate: make judgments based on criteria and standards
Create: put elements together to form a new coherent or functional whole; reorganize elements into a new pattern or structure



Evaluation Criteria:

Understandable: Could you understand what the questions are asking? Please check if the questions are composed in such a way that the questions can be comprehended easily; Options: yes, no

TopicRelated: Are the questions related to the course topic given? Please check if the questions pertain directly to the key themes or concepts of the given course topic; Options: yes, no, NA

Grammatical: Are the questions grammatically well-formed? Please check if the questions adhere to the rules of English grammar; Options: yes, no, NA

Clear: Is it clear what the questions ask for? Please check if the phrasing of the questions leave any doubt about what is being asked. Also check if there's vagueness in the making it difficult to answer the questions; Options: yes, more_or_less, no, NA

Rephrase: Could you rephrase the questions to make it clearer and error-free? Please check if this questions, as it is posed, can be reworded to improve clarity or correct errors while preserving its original meaning. If your answer is yes, rephrase the question; Options: yes, no, NA

Answerable: Can students answer the questions with the information or context provided within? Please check if the question is answerable using the knowledge that the students are expected to have from the course material on the topic provided within the question itself. The course curriculum is a standard undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms course curriculum; Options: yes, no, NA

Central: Do you think being able to answer the questions is important to work on the course topic given? Please check if answering the questions require an understanding of the key concepts that are critical to the subject matter; Options: yes, no, NA

WouldYouUseIt: If you were a teacher teaching the course topic would you use these questions or the rephrased version in the course? Please check if you would consider the questions to be of practical value for teaching and learning, and if it is something that would be chosen for inclusion in course materials or assessments; Options: yes, maybe, no, NA

SkillLevel: Do the questions align to the Bloom's taxonomy level it must align with? Check the standard of questions with the definition. Options: yes, maybe, no, NA

 

Evaluation steps:

1. Read through the questions, the course topic for which the questions have been created, and the evaluation criteria carefully.
2. Check if all the questions are relevant to the topic alone.
3. Check whether the difficulty of questions align to the definition of bloom's taxonomy levels.
4. Go through the evaluation criteria for all questions and based on those, check whether a question is of good quality.
5. Generate a simple feedback for all the questions together explaining whether it can be accepted or not. If not, explain why. 

Questions to evaluate:
### Data Structures and Algorithms - Bloom's Taxonomy: Create

1. Design a detailed algorithm for performing a breadth-first search on a directed graph, emphasizing the steps to maintain a frontier set and track levels of vertices.
2. Propose a method to construct the shortest-path tree for a given vertex in a directed graph, outlining the process of iteratively tracing back to the source vertex.
3. Formulate an approach to identify and list vertices that are unreachable from a specified starting vertex in a graph, highlighting the role of level assignments.
4. Devise a novel application scenario where graph search algorithms such as breadth-first search can be effectively employed, detailing the problem, input, and expected output.
5. Develop a strategy to represent a graph using an adjacency list, explaining how it simplifies the storage and retrieval of graph information efficiently.
6. Create a step-by-step guide on how web crawling can be implemented using graph traversal techniques, illustrating how search engines like Google discover new web pages.
7. Invent a new graph-based algorithm for network broadcast routing, outlining the key data structures and operations involved in efficiently distributing messages across a network.
8. Devise a method to apply breadth-first search to perform garbage collection in a memory-managed environment, highlighting the benefits of using graph traversal for resource cleanup.
9. Design a system that utilizes graph search algorithms to detect and verify mathematical conjectures, discussing the approach's effectiveness and limitations.
10. Propose a novel puzzle-solving strategy using graph theory principles, explaining how graph traversal can be employed to efficiently search for solutions in complex puzzle scenarios.
11. Create a detailed blueprint for model checking using finite state machines, illustrating how graphs can represent system states and transitions for formal verification.
12. Formulate a plan for checking the solvability of a Pocket Cube (2x2x2 Rubik's Cube) configuration graph, detailing the steps to determine the minimum number of moves required to solve any state.
13. Invent an algorithm to identify the hardest-to-solve configurations in a Rubik's Cube, considering factors such as reversibility of moves and the concept of "God's Number" for different cube sizes.
14. Devise a method to extend the breadth-first search algorithm to handle graph exploration tasks in social networking platforms, enabling efficient friend-finding functionality.
15. Create a novel graph-based approach for automated puzzle-solving in games, outlining how graph traversal techniques can be used to explore possible moves and reach optimal solutions in gaming scenarios.
