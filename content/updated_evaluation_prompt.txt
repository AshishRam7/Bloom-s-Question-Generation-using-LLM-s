You are an experienced instructor for an undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms course in Computer Science. 
You have experience creating assessments for the course. Your task is to assess multiple questions based on certain evaluation criteria given.

Please make sure you read and understand the following content and instructions carefully.

Course topic: {topic_list}
Taxonomy Level: Create

Please find the explanation of each level of the Bloom's taxonomy:
Remember: retrieve, recall, or recognize relevant knowledge from long-term memory 
Understand:demonstrate comprehension through one or more forms of explanation 
Apply: use information or a skill in a new situation
Analyze: break material into its constituent parts and determine how the parts relate to one another and/or to an overall structure or purpose
Evaluate: make judgments based on criteria and standards
Create: put elements together to form a new coherent or functional whole; reorganize elements into a new pattern or structure



Evaluation Criteria:

Understandable: Could you understand what the questions are asking? Please check if the questions are composed in such a way that the questions can be comprehended easily; Options: yes, no

TopicRelated: Are the questions related to the course topic given? Please check if the questions pertain directly to the key themes or concepts of the given course topic; Options: yes, no, NA

Grammatical: Are the questions grammatically well-formed? Please check if the questions adhere to the rules of English grammar; Options: yes, no, NA

Clear: Is it clear what the questions ask for? Please check if the phrasing of the questions leave any doubt about what is being asked. Also check if there's vagueness in the making it difficult to answer the questions; Options: yes, more_or_less, no, NA

Rephrase: Could you rephrase the questions to make it clearer and error-free? Please check if this questions, as it is posed, can be reworded to improve clarity or correct errors while preserving its original meaning. If your answer is yes, rephrase the question; Options: yes, no, NA

Answerable: Can students answer the questions with the information or context provided within? Please check if the question is answerable using the knowledge that the students are expected to have from the course material on the topic provided within the question itself. The course curriculum is a standard undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms course curriculum; Options: yes, no, NA

Central: Do you think being able to answer the questions is important to work on the course topic given? Please check if answering the questions require an understanding of the key concepts that are critical to the subject matter; Options: yes, no, NA

WouldYouUseIt: If you were a teacher teaching the course topic would you use these questions or the rephrased version in the course? Please check if you would consider the questions to be of practical value for teaching and learning, and if it is something that would be chosen for inclusion in course materials or assessments; Options: yes, maybe, no, NA

SkillLevel: Do the questions align to the Bloom's taxonomy level it must align with? Check the standard of questions with the definition. Options: yes, maybe, no, NA

 

Evaluation steps:

1. Read through the questions, the course topic for which the questions have been created, and the evaluation criteria carefully.
2. Check if all the questions are relevant to the topic alone.
3. Check whether the difficulty of questions align to the definition of bloom's taxonomy levels.
4. Go through the evaluation criteria for all questions and based on those, check whether a question is of good quality.
5. Generate a simple feedback for all the questions together explaining whether it can be accepted or not. If not, explain why. 

Questions to evaluate:
1. Explain the process of finding the shortest path in a directed graph using the parent pointers starting from vertex v until reaching the source vertex s.
2. Describe the significance of parent pointers in determining the shortest path from a vertex v to the source vertex s in a graph.
3. Compare and contrast the traversal techniques used to navigate through a directed graph with parent pointers for finding the shortest path.
4. Analyze the complexity of finding the shortest path using parent pointers in a directed graph and discuss any potential optimizations.
5. Develop a step-by-step algorithm to trace the shortest path from a given vertex v to the source vertex s using the parent pointers in a directed graph.
6. Evaluate the efficiency of the shortest path algorithm based on parent pointers in a directed graph and propose improvements for enhancing its performance.
7. Formulate a pseudo code for a recursive function that follows parent pointers to determine the shortest path from a vertex v to the source vertex s in a directed graph.
8. Justify the choice of using parent pointers rather than other data structures for navigating through a graph to find the shortest path.
9. Infer the implications of cyclic structures in a directed graph on the process of finding the shortest path using parent pointers.
10. Correlate the concept of parent pointers with tree traversal algorithms and explain how they differ in the context of finding the shortest path.
11. Illustrate the importance of maintaining parent pointers accurately in a directed graph when applying algorithms for pathfinding.
12. Propose a method to handle situations where a vertex does not have a parent pointer while traversing towards the source vertex s in a directed graph.
13. Investigate the role of path compression techniques in optimizing the traversal process based on parent pointers for finding the shortest path.
14. Elaborate on how the choice of starting vertex impacts the efficiency of determining the shortest path using parent pointers in a directed graph.
15. Discuss the challenges associated with updating parent pointers during graph traversal and suggest strategies to overcome these obstacles effectively.

Provide appropriate justification for accepting or rejecting a question.
