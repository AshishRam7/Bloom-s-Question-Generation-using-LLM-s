You are an experienced instructor for an undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms course in Computer Science. 
You have experience creating assessments for the course. Your task is to assess multiple questions based on certain evaluation criteria given.

Please make sure you read and understand the following content and instructions carefully.

Course topic: {topic_list}
Taxonomy Level: Create

Please find the explanation of each level of the Bloom's taxonomy:
Remember: retrieve, recall, or recognize relevant knowledge from long-term memory 
Understand:demonstrate comprehension through one or more forms of explanation 
Apply: use information or a skill in a new situation
Analyze: break material into its constituent parts and determine how the parts relate to one another and/or to an overall structure or purpose
Evaluate: make judgments based on criteria and standards
Create: put elements together to form a new coherent or functional whole; reorganize elements into a new pattern or structure



Evaluation Criteria:

Understandable: Could you understand what the questions are asking? Please check if the questions are composed in such a way that the questions can be comprehended easily; Options: yes, no

TopicRelated: Are the questions related to the course topic given? Please check if the questions pertain directly to the key themes or concepts of the given course topic; Options: yes, no, NA

Grammatical: Are the questions grammatically well-formed? Please check if the questions adhere to the rules of English grammar; Options: yes, no, NA

Clear: Is it clear what the questions ask for? Please check if the phrasing of the questions leave any doubt about what is being asked. Also check if there's vagueness in the making it difficult to answer the questions; Options: yes, more_or_less, no, NA

Rephrase: Could you rephrase the questions to make it clearer and error-free? Please check if this questions, as it is posed, can be reworded to improve clarity or correct errors while preserving its original meaning. If your answer is yes, rephrase the question; Options: yes, no, NA

Answerable: Can students answer the questions with the information or context provided within? Please check if the question is answerable using the knowledge that the students are expected to have from the course material on the topic provided within the question itself. The course curriculum is a standard undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms course curriculum; Options: yes, no, NA

Central: Do you think being able to answer the questions is important to work on the course topic given? Please check if answering the questions require an understanding of the key concepts that are critical to the subject matter; Options: yes, no, NA

WouldYouUseIt: If you were a teacher teaching the course topic would you use these questions or the rephrased version in the course? Please check if you would consider the questions to be of practical value for teaching and learning, and if it is something that would be chosen for inclusion in course materials or assessments; Options: yes, maybe, no, NA

SkillLevel: Do the questions align to the Bloom's taxonomy level it must align with? Check the standard of questions with the definition. Options: yes, maybe, no, NA

 

Evaluation steps:

1. Read through the questions, the course topic for which the questions have been created, and the evaluation criteria carefully.
2. Check if all the questions are relevant to the topic alone.
3. Check whether the difficulty of questions align to the definition of bloom's taxonomy levels.
4. Go through the evaluation criteria for all questions and based on those, check whether a question is of good quality.
5. Generate a simple feedback for all the questions together explaining whether it can be accepted or not. If not, explain why. 

Questions to evaluate:
Here are 15 Create-level questions based on the study material, adhering to Bloom's taxonomy for Data Structures & Algorithms:

1. Design a hybrid recommendation system for hotels that combines Betweenness Centrality scores with collaborative filtering techniques, leveraging insights from the Yelp dataset analysis described in the material.

2. Develop a novel graph-based feature selection method for spam detection that integrates PageRank scores with triadic closure properties, improving upon the existing approaches mentioned in the connected features research.

3. Propose a modified Louvain algorithm variant that incorporates edge weights and node centrality measures to optimize community detection in social networks with heterogeneous connection strengths.

4. Create a pipeline architecture that automatically integrates Label Propagation community detection with triangle count features to enhance machine learning models for link prediction in citation networks.

5. Design an adaptive PageRank implementation using Apache Spark that dynamically adjusts damping factors based on node connectivity patterns observed in transactional graphs.

6. Devise a synergistic system combining weak/strongly connected components analysis with clustering coefficients to identify structurally critical nodes in infrastructure networks while maintaining O(n log n) time complexity.

7. Construct a polynomial-time algorithm for social influence maximization that simultaneously optimizes for Betweenness Centrality and triadic closure properties in multiplex networks, following the voting behavior insights from Figure 8-1.

8. Architect a real-time recommendation engine for Yelp restaurants that dynamically combines community detection results with weighted shortest path calculations across multiple relationship types (reviews, check-ins, social connections).

9. Create a neural network architecture that uses graph embeddings generated from the Bellagio hotel's superconnector identification process as input features for predicting potential high-value customers.

10. Design a privacy-preserving variant of the RA-Brandes algorithm for distributed betweenness centrality computation in healthcare networks, addressing key challenges identified in the real-world implementations.

11. Propose a novel graph convolution operator that integrates triadic census metrics with local clustering coefficients to improve node classification accuracy in social network analysis tasks.

12. Develop a streaming algorithm framework that incrementally updates community structures (using Label Propagation) and influence scores (via PageRank) simultaneously as new edges arrive in dynamic social networks.

13. Create a genetic algorithm approach for optimal pathfinding in transportation networks that combines Yen's k-shortest paths with semi-supervised learning from community detection results.

14. Architect a multi-layer graph analysis pipeline that correlates restaurant category similarity scores with review patterns identified through modularity optimization in the Yelp dataset implementation.

15. Design an adaptive feature importance weighting system for machine learning models that dynamically balances triangle count statistics with community membership features based on current network density metrics.
