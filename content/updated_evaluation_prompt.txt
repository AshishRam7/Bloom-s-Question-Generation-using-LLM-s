WouldYouUseIt: If you were a teacher teaching the course topic would you use these questions or the rephrased version in the course? Please check if you would consider the questions to be of practical value for teaching and learning, and if it is something that would be chosen for inclusion in course materials or assessments; Options: yes, maybe, no, NA

SkillLevel: Do the questions align to the Bloom's taxonomy level it must align with? Check the standard of questions with the definition. Options: yes, maybe, no, NA

 

Evaluation steps:

1. Read through the questions, the course topic for which the questions have been created, and the evaluation criteria carefully.
2. Check if all the questions are relevant to the topic alone.
3. Check whether the difficulty of questions align to the definition of bloom's taxonomy levels.
4. Go through the evaluation criteria for all questions and based on those, check whether a question is of good quality.
5. Generate a simple feedback for all the questions together explaining whether it can be accepted or not. If not, explain why. 

Questions to evaluate:
Here are 15 Create-level questions aligned with Bloom's taxonomy for a Data Structures and Algorithms examination, strictly based on the provided study material:

1. Design a hybrid graph traversal algorithm that combines the queue-based structure of BFS with the backtracking mechanism of DFS to optimize garbage collection route planning in cyclic urban networks. Specify how your algorithm would maintain efficiency while ensuring complete coverage.

2. Create a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm that simultaneously tracks both physical distance and road quality scores (as separate weights) when calculating optimal trucking routes. Outline the data structures required for this dual-weight shortest path implementation.

3. Develop a memory-efficient adaptation of the Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm for IoT sensor networks with constrained edge devices. Incorporate Boruvka's parallel processing approach while considering the graph's sparse nature and energy consumption constraints.

4. Propose a new pathfinding metric that combines hop count, edge weights, and node centrality measures for emergency response routing systems. Formalize your composite cost function and justify how it would improve upon traditional shortest path calculations.

5. Construct a distributed processing framework that integrates both node-centric and relationship-centric approaches to handle real-time updates in a dynamic transportation graph. Specify how you would manage synchronization between Spark partitions and Neo4j graph database updates.

6. Design a hybrid recommendation system that employs both personalized PageRank for user similarity and random walks with restart for serendipitous discovery in a bipartite user-product graph. Detail the graph schema and walk propagation rules.

7. Create an adaptive algorithm selector that automatically chooses between A* and Yen's k-Shortest Paths based on real-time traffic density metrics and anticipated query complexity. Outline your decision criteria matrix and switching mechanism.

8. Develop a novel graph compression technique leveraging properties of k-partite structures to optimize memory usage for large-scale social network analysis in Neo4j. Include specific node labeling strategies and relationship storage optimizations.

9. Propose a modified Strongly Connected Components algorithm that identifies bridge nodes between components while calculating connectivity. Implement this using message passing in a node-centric processing model and specify the additional data structures required.

10. Design a dynamic graph partitioning scheme for the All Pairs Shortest Path problem that minimizes network shuffling in Spark while handling frequent edge weight updates. Incorporate delta-stepping concepts and define your persistence strategy.

11. Create a multi-criteria optimization framework for the Single Source Shortest Path problem that balances fuel efficiency, toll costs, and carbon emissions in logistics planning. Formalize your constraint satisfaction model and implement it as an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm.

12. Develop a graph sampling technique combining random walks with Hamiltonian path detection to create representative subgraphs for machine learning training. Specify your node selection criteria and termination conditions while maintaining path connectivity.

13. Propose a new centrality metric that synthesizes betweenness centrality with temporal edge weights to identify critical infrastructure nodes in evolving power grid networks. Formalize your time-aware centrality calculation formula.

14. Design a parallelized implementation of the Eulerian path detection algorithm optimized for Neo4j's native graph storage. Include Cypher query optimizations and index strategies to efficiently verify the degree parity condition across large datasets.

15. Create a disaster recovery protocol for distributed graph processing that maintains algorithm state consistency across Spark worker nodes and Neo4j database replicas during network partitions. Specify your checkpointing strategy and failover mechanisms.

These questions require students to synthesize multiple concepts from the study materials, develop novel solutions, and create optimized implementations while considering real-world constraints and system architectures mentioned in the context.
