The graph shows a directed graph with vertices labeled 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph is unordered, meaning there are no edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph has directed edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph has directed edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.

The graph also demonstrates that the adjacency list of vertices is a direct representation of the graph, where each vertex is connected to its neighbors. The graph further shows that the adjacency list can be divided by 24 to simplify the graph representation. The graph shows the breadth-first search algorithm for finding vertices reachable from a given path of edges. The algorithm explores graph level 0 (s) and level 1 (s) first. It finds that vertices reachable from path s of length at least level 1 (s) are not reachable from path s of length at least level 0 (s). The graph shows a hierarchical structure, with vertices labeled 'level' and 'parent'. Vertex 'level' is connected to 'parent' by edges labeled 'next' and 'not yet seen'.
