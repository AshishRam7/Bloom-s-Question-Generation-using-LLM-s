The graph shows a directed graph with vertices labeled 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph is unordered, meaning there are no edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph has directed edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph has directed edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph has directed edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph has directed edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph has directed edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph shows a network of nodes connected by edges, with each node representing a possible state. The number of possible states is determined by the formula (11 for 2 x 2) x (20 for 3 x 3), where (n) is the number of nodes and (n) is the numb er of nodes in the first move. The graph also shows the number of reachable states for each node, represented by the number of steps in the tree. The graph shows that there are 8 vertices and 3 edges in a Rubik's Cube. The number of possible configurations (264, 539, 520) is determined by the number of vertices (8) and the number of edges (3). The graph also demonstrates that the adjacency list of vertices is a direct representation of the graph, where each vertex is connected to its neighbors. The graph further shows that the adjacency list can be divided by 24 to simplify the graph representation. The graph shows the breadth-first search algorithm for finding vertices reachable from a given path of edges. The algorithm explores graph level 0 (s) and level 1 (s) first. It finds that vertices reachable from path s of length at least level 1 (s) are not reachable from path s of length at least level 0 (s). The graph shows a hierarchical structure, with vertices labeled 'level' and 'parent'. Vertex 'level' is connected to 'parent'  Lecture 13 Graphs I: BFS 6.006 Fall 2011 Lecture 13: Graphs I: Breadth First Search Lecture Overview e Applications of Graph Search e Graph Representations e Breadth-First Search Recall: Graph G = (V, ) e V = set of vertices (arbitrary labels) e EF = set of edges i.e. vertex pairs (v, w)  ordered pair => directed edge of graph  unordered pair = > undirected eg.

The graph shows the time complexity of Adj(j) as O(eV) for directed graphs and O(eV) for undirected graphs. It also demonstrates that O(eV) is used to list vertices unreachable from those not assigned a level. Furthermore, it shows that the shortest path in a directed graph is found by taking the lowest-cost edge from each unvisited vertex. The visualization shows a significant increase in the number of citations for the introduction to algorithms course from Fall 2011 to Fall 2012. This trend indicates a growth in popularity and demand for the course. The number of citations increased from 6,006 in Fall 2011 to 6,000 in Fall 2012, representing a notable increase in the course's reach and impact. e-based implementation level = { s: 0} parent = {s : None } i=1 frontier = [s] # previous level, i  1 while frontier: next = [] # next level, 7 for wu in frontier: for v in Adj [ul: if v not in level: # not yet seen level[v] = i { = level{u] +1 parent[v] = u next.append(v) frontier = next i+=1 Example level 0 level 1 -o. frontier, = {s} frontier, = {a, x} frontier, = {z, d, c} frontier, = {f, v} (not x, c, d) level 2 level 3 Figure 4: Breadth-First Search Frontier Analysis: e vertex V enters next (& then frontier) only once (because level[v] then set) base case: v = Lecture 13 Graphs I: BFS 6.006 Fall 2011 e => Adj{v] looped through only once time = > |Adj[V]}| = veV |E| for directed graphs 2|E| for undirected graphs e = O(E) time e O(V + E) (LINEAR TIME) to also list vertices unreachable from v (those still not assigned level) Shortest Paths: cf.
