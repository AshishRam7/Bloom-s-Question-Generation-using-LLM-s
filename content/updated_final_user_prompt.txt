The graph shows a directed graph with vertices labeled 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph is unordered, meaning there are no edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph has directed edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph has directed edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph has directed edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph has directed edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph has directed edges between vertices 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The graph shows a network of nodes connected by edges, with each node representing a possible state. The number of possible states is determined by the formula (11 for 2 x 2) x (20 for 3 x 3), where (n) is the number of nodes and (n) is the numb for each v => to find shortest path, take v, parent{v], parent[parent[v]], etc., until s (or None) MIT OpenCourseWare http://ocw.mit.edu 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms Fall 2011 For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.
