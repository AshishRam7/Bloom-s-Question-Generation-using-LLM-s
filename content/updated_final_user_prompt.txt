It p away before The algorithm was first published in 1959 by Edward F. Moore, who used it to find the shortest path out of a maze. It was then developed into a wire rou by C. Y. Lee in 1961, as described in An Algorithm for Path Conne Applications. BES is most commonly used as the basis for other more goal-oriented al ing algorithm ctions and Its gorithms. For example, Shortest Path, Connected Components, and Closeness Centrality all use the BFS algorithm. It can also be used to find the shortest path between nodes. Figure 4-3 shows the order in which we would visit the nodes of our tr: ansport graph if w eighted path from a root node to all other nodes. The algorithm starts with a root node and measures paths from it. The relationship between the root node and the selected node is the smallest weight. The algorithm then selects the next node with the smallest weight, adding it to the tree and its connected node. The algorithm continues until there are no more nodes to add, and the chosen path is the shortest. The visualization shows that single source shortest path algorithms can be adapted to use aggregates of messages from multiple sources. It demonstrates how to calculate the shortest path between two locations using Dijkstra's algorithm, and how to use the Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm for a single-source shortest path. The algorithm is designed to handle situations where users need to visit every node in a single route, such as garbage collection, and can be customized to work with different network architectures. The visualization demonstrates a pathfinding algorithm using a graph data structure.  The visualization shows a consistent trend of increasing numerical values over time. There are no discernible patterns or outliers. The data appears to be uniformly distributed across the range of values presented. Graph search algorithms explore a graph for general discovery or explicit search. They are computationally optimal and cover breadth first search and depth first search. These paths are often found by many other algorithms. The graph search algorithm explores routes between nodes, starting at one node and traversing through relationships until the destination is reached. These algorithms use optimal algorithms for finding the shortest path, shortest path with two chosen nodes, shortest path with single source shortest path, minimum spanning tree, and random walk. The graph search algorithms exhibit a variety of paths, with different lengths and weights. The breadth-first search algorithm visits the nearest neighbor first, while the depth-first search explores each branch first. Pathfinding algorithms use different opt tonian cycles have a special historical significance, with the Knigsberg bridges problem being a notable example. The shortest path algorithm is used for user interactions and dynamic workflows, as it works in real time. The text discusses pathfinding algorithms, specifically Dijkstra's Shortest Path, and its application to graph analysis. It highlights the importance of finding the lowest-weighted path, using weighted edges and nodes. The algorithm calculates the cumulative weight of a path, evaluates distances between nodes, and chooses the shortest path. The text also notes that the algorithm considers the number of hops between nodes and the sum of their weights. The Shortest Path algorithm with Neo4j is based on collaboration with Paul Erdos, a prolific mathematician of the twentieth century. It assumes that adding a relationship to a path will never make it a path shorter than an invariant that would be violated with negative weights. The algorithm uses weighted shortest paths to compute the shortest path between all nodes. ph analytics is important to studying real-world networks and looked at fundamental graph concepts, analysis, and pro- cessing. This puts us on solid footing for understanding how to apply graph algo- rithms. In the next chapters, we'll discover how to run graph algorithms with examples in Spark and Neo4j. Summary | 37 CHAPTER 4 Pathfinding and Graph Search Algorithms Graph search algorithms explore a graph either for general discovery or explicit search. These algorithms carve paths through the graph, but there is no expectation that those paths are computationally optimal. We will cover Breadth First Search and Depth First Search because they are fundamental for traversing a graph and are often a required first step for many other types of analysis. Pathfinding algorithms build on top of graph search algorithms and explore routes between nodes, starting at one node and traversing through relationships until the destination has been reached. These algorithms are used to identify optimal routes through a graph for uses such as lo  Figure 4-4. Depth First Search starting from Den Haag. Node numbers indicate the order traversed. Notice how different the node order is compared to BFS. For this DFS, we start by traversing from Den Haag to Amsterdam, and are then able to get to every other node in the graph without needing to backtrack at all! We can see how search algorithms lay the groundwork for moving through graphs. Now lets look at the pathfinding algorithms that find the cheapest path in terms of the number of hops or weight. Weights can be anything measured, such as time, dis- tance, capacity, or cost. 48 | Chapter 4: Pathfinding and Graph Search Algorithms Two Special Paths/Cycles There are two special paths in graph analysis that are worth noting. First, an Eulerian path is one where every relationship is visited exactly once. Second, a Hamiltonian path is one where every node is visited exactly once. A path can be both Eulerian and Hamiltonian, and if you start and finish at the same node its considered a cycle or tour.  path in a connected tree Optimizing connected No Yes structure with the smallest cost for routing, such as laying cable visiting all nodes or garbage collection Random Walk Returns a list of nodes along a path of || Augmenting training for No Yes specified size by randomly choosing machine learning or data for relationships to traverse. graph algorithms. First we'll take a look at the dataset for our examples and walk through how to import the data into Apache Spark and Neo4j. For each algorithm, we'll start with a short description of the algorithm and any pertinent information on how it operates. Most sections also include guidance on when to use related algorithms. Finally, we provide working sample code using the sample dataset at the end of each algorithm section. Let's get started! Example Data: The Transport Graph All connected data contains paths between nodes, which is why search and pathfind- ing are the starting points for graph analytics. Transportation datasets illustrate these relationships in an intuitive and acce earch Algorithms Table 4-1.

The nodes can also combine messages for transmission during the communication phase, which helpfully reduces the amount of net- work chatter. The algorithm completes when either no new mes- sages are sent or a set limit has been reached. 30 | Chapter 3: Graph Platforms and Processing Most of these graph-specific approaches require the presence of the entire graph for efficient cross-topological operations. This is because separating and distributing the graph data leads to extensive data transfers and reshuffling between worker instances. This can be difficult for the many algorithms that need to iteratively process the global graph structure. Representative Platforms To address the requirements of graph processing, several platforms have emerged. Traditionally there was a separation between graph compute engines and graph data- bases, which required users to move their data depending on their process needs: Graph comp  numerically, with specific values assigned to different aspects of the graph. The visualization shows that graph processing is a complex, structure-driven, globally focused, and difficult to parse process. It involves investments in distributed computing frameworks and related algorithms. The paper also discusses the concept of scalability, comparing a system with a well-configured system to one with an optimized algorithm and data structure. It highlights the importance of measuring performance gains without rewarding systems that mask inefficiencies through parallelization. The visualization shows that different graph processing approaches exhibit varying degrees of efficiency and memory utilization. Specifically, node-centric methods tend to be more memory-efficient and faster, while relationship-centric methods can handle larger graphs and require more computational resources. Graph-centric methods are also more memory-efficient and faster for smaller graphs. Traversal-centric methods are the least memory-intensive but can b  types, the importance of graph theory in understanding graph structures, and the increasing use of graph databases and algorithms. The table also highlights the increasing use of pathfinding and community detection techniques in graph analysis. The document presents a summary of graph platforms and processing, focusing on graph platforms and processing considerations. Key findings include the number of graph platforms (29), processing considerations (29), and representative platforms (31). Specific findings include the number of shortest paths (39), shortest paths with and without Neo4j (50), shortest paths with Apache Spark (53), shortest paths with Weights (51), shortest paths with Weights (56), shortest paths with Variation (58), shortest paths with Weights (60), shortest paths with All pairs shortest paths (60), shortest paths with All pairs shortest paths (62), shortest paths with Apache Spark (63), shortest paths with Weights (65), shortest paths with Weights (69), single source shortest path (65), single source shortest p  The cost of this path is 74.0. The graph also shows the cost of the longest path, which is from Amsterdam to London via Colchester, Ipswich, and Felixstowe. The cost of this path is 108.9. The visualization shows that random walks can be used as a pathfinding algorithm, often following a path length. It also demonstrates that random walks can be used to model relationships between nodes, with neighbors influencing the probability of a node being walked through. The algorithm uses a random walk to choose a path, and the number of nodes and path length are determined by randomness. The algorithm used a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach, moving onto Dijkstra's algorithm and other shortest path algorithms. It found the shortest path from a node to all other nodes or between all pairs of nodes in a graph. The algorithm also used a Random Walk algorithm to find arbitrary paths. The visualization shows a trend of increasing complexity as the number of nodes increases. It also reveals a pattern where the number of nodes in a graph gener gistics planning, least cost call or IP routing, and gaming simulation. Specifically, the pathfinding algorithms we'll cover are:  Shortest Path, with two useful variations (A* and Yen's): finding the shortest path or paths between two chosen nodes + All Pairs Shortest Path and Single Source Shortest Path: for finding the shortest paths between all pairs or from a chosen node to all others  Minimum Spanning Tree: for finding a connected tree structure with the smallest cost for visiting all nodes from a chosen node  Random Walk: because its a useful preprocessing/sampling step for machine learning workflows and other graph algorithms In this chapter we'll explain how these algorithms work and show examples in Spark and Neo4j. In cases where an algorithm is only available in one platform, we'll pro- vide just that one example or illustrate how you can customize our implementation. 39 Figure 4-1 shows the key differences between these types of algorithms, and Table 4-1 is a quick reference to what each algorithm computes with an ex  In this chapter we started out with the fundamental Breadth and Depth First algorithms, before moving onto Dijkstra and other shortest path algorithms. We also looked at variants of the shortest path algorithms optimized for finding the shortest path from one node to all other nodes or between all pairs of nodes in a graph. We finished with the Random Walk algorithm, which can be used to find arbitrary sets of paths. Summary | 75 Next we'll learn about Centrality algorithms that can be used to find influential nodes in a graph.

Shortest Path The Shortest Path algorithm calculates the shortest (weighted) path between a pair of nodes. Its useful for user interactions and dynamic workflows because it works in real time. Shortest Path | 49 Pathfinding has a history dating back to the 19th century and is considered to be a classic graph problem. It gained prominence in the early 1950s in the context of alter- nate routing; that is, finding the second-shortest route if the shortest route is blocked. In 1956, Edsger Dijkstra created the best-known of these algorithms. Dijkstras Shortest Path algorithm operates by first finding the lowest-weight relation- ship from the start node to directly connected nodes. It keeps track of those weights and moves to the closest node. It then performs the same calculation, but now as a cumulative total from the start node. The algorithm continues to do this, evaluating a wave of cumulative weights and always choosing the lowest weighted cumulative   Graph Platform and Processing Considerations Graph analytical processing has unique qualities such as computation that is structure-driven, globally focused, and difficult to parse. In this section we'll look at the general considerations for graph platforms and processing. Platform Considerations There's debate as to whether its better to scale up or scale out graph processing.

Pathfinding and search algorithms 40 | Chapter 4: Pathfinding and Graph S  It starts at a source node labeled 'g1' and traverses a graph to reach a destination node labeled 'g2'. The algorithm uses a depth-first search and maintains a distance of 'd' between nodes. The algorithm uses a depth-first search to find the shortest path between g1 and g2. The algorithm uses a depth-first search to find the shortest path between g1 and g2. The visualization shows the physical distances between nodes in a graph, ordered by shortest distance. It also demonstrates the use of the Delta-Stepping algorithm to calculate these distances. The algorithm uses a variation of SSSP, which divides the graph into a number of phases, allowing for parallel execution. The distances are represented as numbers, with values ranging from 0 to 360 kilometers. The Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm finds all reachable nodes and connects them with the minimum possible weight. It traverses the graph with the lowest weight from each visited node, avoiding cycles. The algorithm was first developed in 1926 by Czech scientist Oktakar Borivka a e: columns = [column for column in result.columns if not column.startswith("e")] result.select(columns) .show() If we run the code in pyspark we'll see this output: from vl v2 to [Den Haag, 52.078... [Hoek van Holland... [Felixstowe, 51.9... [Ipswich, 52.0591... As expected, the bfs algorithm returns Ipswich! Remember that this function is satis- fied when it finds the first match, and as you can see in Figure 4-3, Ipswich is evalu- ated before Colchester. Breadth First Search | 47 Depth First Search Depth First Search (DFS) is the other fundamental graph traversal algorithm. It starts from a chosen node, picks one of its neighbors, and then traverses as far as it can along that path before backtracking. DFS was originally invented by French mathematician Charles Pierre Trmaux as a strategy for solving mazes. It provides a useful tool to simulate possible paths for sce- nario modeling. Figure 4-4 shows the order in which we would visit the nodes of our transport graph if we were performing a DFS that started from Den Haag.  The steps to calculate the shortest path from node A to all other nodes, with updates shaded. Initially the algorithm assumes an infinite distance to all nodes. When a start node is selected, then the distance to that node is set to 0. The calculation then proceeds as follows: 1. From start node A we evaluate the cost of moving to the nodes we can reach and update those values. Looking for the smallest value, we have a choice of B (cost of 3) or C (cost of 1). C is selected for the next phase of traversal. 2. Now from node C, the algorithm updates the cumulative distances from A to nodes that can be reached directly from C. Values are only updated when a lower cost has been found: A=0, B=3, C=1, D=8, E=@ 3. Then B is selected as the next closest node that hasn't already been visited. It has relationships to nodes A, D, and E. The algorithm works out the distance to those nodes by summing the distance from A to B with the distance from B to each of those nodes. Note that the lowest cost from the start node A to the current node i  the number of relationships between them. The visualization shows the first match between Ipswich and Den Haag. It highlights the first match's significance, noting that the bfs function returns Ipswich before Ipswich. The bfs function is evaluated on a dataset of 100,000 and 300,000 people, and the first match was found in Ipswich. The DFS algorithm starts from a chosen node and traverses its neighbors, moving forward along the path before backtracking. The algorithm is inspired by Pierre Tremaux's strategy for solving mazes. The nodes in the graph are numbered sequentially, starting from 1. The algorithm's order traverses the graph without needing to backtrack, and it can find the cheapest path in terms of time, distance, capacity, or cost. The visualization shows that Eulerian and Hamiltonian cycles are distinct. Eulerian cycles are characterized by a path where every node is visited exactly once, while Hamiltonian cycles have a path where every node is visited at least once. The graph also illustrates that Eulerian and Hamil a) Breadth First Search with, 46 Closeness Centrality with, 86-88 Connected Components with, 125-126 Index Degree Centrality with, 83 importing social graph data into, 80 importing software dependency graph data into, 114 importing transport dataset into, 43 installing, 34 Label Propagation with, 130 online resources, 228 PageRank with, 103-105 personalized PageRank with, 107 Shortest Path algorithm (weighted), 54-56 Single Source Shortest Path algorithm with, 67-69 Spark Graph project, 33 Strongly Connected Components with, 120 Triangle Count with, 117 when to use, 31 Approximate Betweenness Centrality, 160 artificial intelligence (AI), 183 average degree, 81 average shortest path, 27 Awesome Procedures on Cypher (APOC) library, 35, 148, 192, 228 B Bacon number, 50 Barabasi, Albert-Laszld, 11 Betweenness Centrality algorithm, 78, 92-99 bridges and control points, 93 calculating, 93 when to use, 94 with Neo4j, 95-97 with Yelp dataset, 159-162 binary classification, 200 231 bipartite graphs, 18, 25 Boruvka, Otakar, 70 Breadth Firs abel Propagation with, 131-133 local clustering coefficient with, 118 Louvain Modularity with, 138-143 Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm with, 72 online resources, 228 PageRank with, 105-107 Random Walk algorithm with, 74 234 =| Index Randomized-Approximate Brandes with, 98 Shortest Path algorithm (unweighted), 51-53 Shortest Path algorithm (weighted), 53 Single Source Shortest Path algorithm with, 69 Strongly Connected Components with, 122-124 Triangles with, 117 when to use, 32 Yen's k-Shortest Paths algorithm, 58 Neo4j Algorithms library Shortest Path (unweighted), 51-53 Shortest Path (weighted), 53 Neo4j Desktop, 36 Neo4j Graph Platform, 34-37 Neo4j Import tool, 225-227 Network Science, 4 networks graph as representation of, 3 types and structures, 16 Newman, M.

Whats in This Book This book is a practical guide to getting started with graph algorithms for developers and data scientists who have experience using Apache Spark or Neo4j. Although our algorithm examples utilize the Spark and Neo4j platforms, this book will also be help- ful for understanding more general graph concepts, regardless of your choice of graph technologies. The first two chapters provide an introduction to graph analytics, algorithms, and theory. The third chapter briefly covers the platforms used in this book before we dive into three chapters focusing on classic graph algorithms: pathfinding, centrality, and community detection. We wrap up the book with two chapters showing how graph algorithms are used within workflows: one for general analysis and one for machine learning. At the beginning of each category of algorithms, there is a reference table to help yo van Holland > 4 otterdam Joek van Holland > 1, Immingham  3, Colchester  4) Utrecht Immingham  2, Hoek van Holland  3, Colchester > 5 The number next to each location in the distances column is the number of rela- tionships (roads) between cities we need to traverse to get there from the source node. In our example, Colchester is one of our destination cities and you can see it has 0 nodes to traverse to get to itself but 3 hops to make from Immingham and Hoek van Holland. If we were planning a trip, we could use this information to help maxi- mize our time at our chosen destinations. All Pairs Shortest Path with Neo4j Neo4j has a parallel implementation of the All Pairs Shortest Path algorithm, which returns the distance between every pair of nodes. The first parameter to this procedure is the property to use to work out the shortest weighted path. If we set this to null then the algorithm will calculate the unweighted shortest paths between all pairs of nodes. The following query does this: CALL algo.allShortestPaths. imization techniques, with some paths being shorter than others. The shortest path problem calculates the number of hops between nodes. The random pathfinding algorithm explores a random walk, connecting nodes randomly. The minimum spanning tree problem finds the shortest path connecting all nodes with the lowest weight. The visualization shows that all connected data points form paths between nodes, demonstrating the importance of path analytics in understanding network behavior. It also highlights the use of Apache Spark and Neo4j for example, showcasing their capabilities for importing data and querying relationships. The example data includes a transport graph illustrating pathfinding against a subgraph of the European road network. The visualization shows the target graph, which is a graph search problem. The data points represent different cities and their relationships with the target graph. The x-axis represents the relationship cost, ranging from 0 to 35. The y-axis represents the population, ranging from 32 to 5,000,000
