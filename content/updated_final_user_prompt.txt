Superconnec- tors who rate the Bellagio well become our proxy for estimating which restaurants might catch the eye of new types of target visitors. Now that we have helped the Bellagio reach new groups, we're going to see how we can use community detection to further improve our app. Finding Similar Categories While our end users are using the app to find hotels, we want to showcase other busi- nesses they might be interested in.

Summary Centrality algorithms are an excellent tool for identifying influencers in a network. In this chapter weve learned about the prototypical centrality algorithms: Degree Cen- trality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. We've also cov- ered several variations to deal with issues such as long runtimes and isolated c internationally or locally. The text discusses graph algorithms and entities, noting that relationships between them are often not strictly directional but can be more so. It also highlights the importance of relationships and transitive relations in graph models, particularly when there are numerous entities and relationships. Finally, it emphasizes the potential for disconnected or unrelated entities in graph models. The graph model successfully identifies the campaign manager's perspective, the standard relationship model fails to identify the campaign manager's perspective, and the standard relationship model is ineffective. The graph analyzes a transaction through the transitory relationship between marketing campaign and final customer purchase, showing a positive ROI. The graph analyzes a transaction through the transitory relationship between marketing campaign and final customer purchase, showing a positive ROI. The graph analyzes a transaction through the transitory relationship between marketing campaign and final cust  The visualization shows that adding "Friends" voting to social networks significantly increases the number of votes added. It also demonstrates that friends reporting voting influence have a more substantial impact than friends directly involved. Small percentages of users can have a significant impact, and the number of friends who can influence a user is relatively small. The graph highlights the importance of social networks in influencing voting behavior. The visualization shows that feature extraction is a process that extracts large volumes of data and attributes them to representative descriptive attributes. It demonstrates that the process can be used to analyze data from different categories, even when the data is difficult to interpret. The visualization also highlights the importance of feature selection, showing that it can lead to more accurate predictions by focusing on relevant features. Furthermore, the visualization reveals that feature extraction can be combined with other methods, such as graph-based queries,   Interestingly, the authors found extracting connected features from multiple types of relationships even more predictive than simply adding more fea- tures. The Report Subgraph section shows how graph features are converted into fea- tures that the ML model can use. By combining multiple methods in a graph- enhanced ML workflow, the authors were able to improve prior detection methods and classify 70% of spammers that had previously required manual labeling, with 90% accuracy. Even once we have extracted connected features, we can improve our training by using graph algorithms like PageRank to prioritize the features with the most influ- ence. This enables us to adequately represent our data while eliminating noisy vari- ables that could degrade results or slow processing. With this type of information, we can also identify features with high co-occurrence for further model tuning via fea- ture reduction. This method is outlined in the research paper Using PageRank in Feature Selection, by D. Ienco, R. Meo, and M. Botta. on Experiment in Social Influence and Political Mobiliza- tion, by R. Bond et al. 184 | Chapter 8: Using Graph Algorithms to Enhance Machine Learning Friends Voting Friends of Friends Voting \Voted" IVoted" \Voted" Button Button Button 60M Facebook Users Added 886K Votes Added 1M Votes Figure 8-1. People are influenced to vote by their social networks. In this example, friends two hops away had more total impact than direct relationships. The authors found that friends reporting voting influenced an additional 1.4% of users to also claim theyd voted and, interestingly, friends of friends added another 1.7%. Small percentages can have a significant impact, and we can see in Figure 8-1 that people at two hops out had in total more impact than the direct friends alone. Voting and other examples of how our social networks impact us are covered in the book Connected, by Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler (Little, Brown and Com- pany). Adding graph features and context improves predictions, especially in situations where connections  ph analysis. Specifically, it highlights the use of SSPs, the application of A* algorithms, and the importance of social data in graph analysis. The findings also emphasize the use of weighted graphs, the significance of triangular graphs, and the application of unweighted graphs. Furthermore, the visualization reveals the use of Weights and Weights with Neo4j, the importance of structural graphs, and the application of weighting properties. The visualization also highlights the use of Yelp datasets for analyzing cross-promotion and finding influential hotel reviewers. The visualization shows the usage of the NeoJ Import tool for social network analysis across various industries. It highlights the popularity of the NeoJ Import tool for social network analysis, with a user count of 146. Additionally, it notes the use of trip planning apps and shortest paths algorithms, both with user counts of 58. The text discusses Mark Needham's work on graph-based solutions for graph data. He uses deep learning and graph-based approaches to bui  The visualization further explores the relationship between viewers and TV shows, showing that viewers are more likely to watch shows with similar ratings than those with different ratings. It also explores the relationship between viewers and the number of viewers in common. Finally, it explores the relationship between viewers and the number of viewers in common. The graph shows the relationship between viewers and TV shows, categorized by the number of episodes watched. Bipartite graphs are often used to project these data to monopartite graphs for more detailed analysis. The number of active viewers (combined) is significantly higher than the number of shows in common (combined). The visualization shows that graph algorithms are fundamental to graph analysis, often used for pathfinding and search. Pathfinding algorithms typically find the shortest path between two nodes, with the lowest weight. Connectivity analysis focuses on finding communities within networks, often using quasi-findings.  Specifically, it demonstrates that as the number of vertices increases, the number of edges also increases, and the degree of each edge is proportional to the square root of the number of vertices. This trend is consistent across all the graphs shown. The document shows the release date of the first edition, which is 2019-04-15. It also highlights the collaboration between O'Reilly Media, Inc. and Neo4j, a company specializing in enterprise-scale data management.

Connected feature extraction can be combined with other predictive methods to improve results. AUPR refers to the area under the precision-recall curve, with higher numbers preferred. We've discussed how connected features are applied to scenarios involving fraud and spammer detection. In these situations, activities are often hidden in multiple layers of obfuscation and network relationships. Traditional feature extraction and selection methods may be unable to detect that behavior without the contextual information that graphs bring. ir customer base by attracting new guests from different types of communities as a greenfield opportu- nity. We can use the Betweenness Centrality algorithm that we discussed earlier to work out which Bellagio reviewers are not only well connected across the whole Yelp network, but might also act as a bridge between different groups. We're only interested in finding influencers in Las Vegas, so we'll first tag those users: MATCH (u:User) WHERE exists((u)-[:WROTE]->()-[:REVIEWS]->()-[:IN_CITY]-> (:City {mame: "Las Vegas"})) SET u:LasVegas Analyzing Yelp Data with Neo4j | 159 It would take a long time to run the Betweenness Centrality algorithm over our Las Vegas users, so instead we'll use the the RA-Brandes variant. This algorithm calculates a betweenness score by sampling nodes and only exploring shortest paths to a certain depth. After some experimentation, we improved results with a few parameters set differ- ently than the default values. We'll use shortest paths of up to 4 hops (maxDepth of 4) and sample 20% of the nodes (pr een 50 and 100) have reviewed restaurants. The average review count for restaurants is higher than for hotels. The visualization shows the top 50 influential connectors in Las Vegas restaurants, identified by their average review and number of reviews. It also highlights the top 10 restaurants with the highest average review and number of reviews. The data suggests a positive correlation between the number of reviews and the average review, indicating that restaurants with more reviews tend to have higher average reviews. This analysis can be used to recommend restaurants to new guests, as the data indicates a strong positive trend in customer satisfaction. The visualization shows a projected categories graph with a link between two categories: Business and Historical Tours. The graph has a weight of 1, as seen in Figure 7-9. The graph also uses Label Propagation to cluster similar categories. The similarity graph is not created but runs a community detection algorithm. The similarity graph uses Label Propagation to cluster simil ath (69), minimum spanning tree (70), minimum spanning tree with Neo4j (71), random walk (74), and random walk with Neo4j (73). The visualization presents a collection of Centrality Algorithms and Community Detection Algorithms, each with a series of technical findings. The Centrality Algorithms section explores various metrics like Degree Centrality, Reach, and Influence, along with their corresponding values. The Community Detection Algorithms section focuses on graph data analysis, including importing data into Neo4j, using PageRank, and leveraging Apache Spark. Both sections highlight trends and patterns, with values ranging from 79 to 120. The visualization presents a collection of graph algorithms used in practice, categorized by their application areas. Specifically, it highlights the use of connected components with Neo4j, labeled components with Apache Spark, and semi-supervised learning and seed labels. The graph also shows the popularity of different algorithms, their usage in travel businesses, and their application i ection of decision trees and uses the most popular prediction. The visualization demonstrates how to compute triangle counts using a clustering coefficient function. It shows how to apply this function to training and test dataframes, using minimum and maximum counts. The code uses a dictionary of strings for parameters, and the algorithm calculates the counts for each row in the dataframe. The visualization shows descriptive statistics for various triangle features. Specifically, it displays the count, mean, min, max, and min/max coefficients for the number of triangles and the number of triangles in each triangle. The data is presented in two tables, one for summary statistics and another for the actual values. The code running the visualization demonstrates how to extract these statistics from the training data. The model's performance has improved significantly. Adding new features to the model has led to increased accuracy and precision. The model's predictions have become more accurate and precise over time. f_model = triangle_model.stages[-1] plot_feature_importance(fields, rf_model.featureImportances) The results of running that function can be seen in Figure 8-14.

Feature importance: triangles model The common authors feature still has the greatest single impact on our model. Per- haps we need to look at new areas and see what happens when we add community information. Predicting Links: Community Detection We hypothesize that nodes that are in the same community are more likely to have a link between them if they dont already. Moreover, we believe that the tighter a com- munity is, the more likely links are. First, we'll compute more coarse-grained communities using the Label Propagation algorithm in Neo4j.

The definition of a more coarse-grained network based on the communities found in the first step. This coarse-grained network will be used in the next itera- tion of the algorithm.

He works to help users embrace graphs and Neo4j, building sophisticated solutions to challenging data problems. Mark has deep expertise in graph data, having previously help  The model's performance improves over time, especially in the last 90% of data. The ROC curve shows increasing accuracy as the model's importance features are changed. The model achieves a high AUC (0.50) and improved prediction rate (0.8) in the last 90% of data. The common authors feature has the greatest single impact on our model. Performing feature analysis on new data helps us understand how adding community impacts our model. Specifically, we found that common authors have the highest average impact, followed by minTriangles, maxTriangles, and so on. The average impact is 0.1, and the range is 0.6. The visualization shows that the Louvain algorithm can efficiently compute finer-grained clusters using the Louvain algorithm. It also demonstrates that the algorithm can store the smallest of these clusters in the property `louvainTrain` for the training set and `louvainTest` for the test set. Specifically, the algorithm yields smaller communities as node communities (as smaller community sizes) with the number of nodes (as no upercommunities. Run over multiple iterations. Relationship weights and totals are used to determine grouping, Figure 6-1. Representative community detection algorithms We use the terms set, partition, cluster, group, and community inter- changeably. These terms are different ways to indicate that similar nodes can be grouped. Community detection algorithms are also called clustering and partitioning algorithms. In each section, we use the terms that are most prominent in the literature for a partic- ular algorithm. 110 | Chapter 6: Community Detection Algorithms Table 6-1.

However, it does provide a good representation. Mark Newman explains this in detail in his book *Networks: An Introduction*. The visualization shows that the centrality of Alice is the main broker in the network, but Mark and Doug are not far behind. The smaller subgraphs exhibit the shortest paths, indicating efficient information flow. The centrality of Alice is proportional to the product of the number of nodes, suggesting a logarithmic relationship. The algorithm for centrality computation is fast, and the nodes are known to each other. The algorithm works by filtering down to relationships with a subset of nodes. The visualization shows a network of users connected by relationships. The centrality of Jason is highlighted, suggesting he acts as a bridge between the two sets of users. The graph also shows a high centrality score for Jason, indicating strong communication between users. The overall network is dense, with a mix of users and relationships. The visualization shows that calculating the exact betweenness  . The visualization shows a spider web with a spider at the center. The web is composed of interconnected lines and nodes, suggesting a network structure. The spider's body is segmented, and its legs are spread out. The number of nodes in the web appears to be roughly equal to the number of edges. The spider's coloration is predominantly orange and brown. The overall pattern suggests a hierarchical structure, with the spider at the top and the web spreading outwards. The visualization shows a group of data scientists working together on a project. They are using Neo4j, a powerful platform for connected data, with native graph analytics, storage, and processing. Graph algorithms reveal hidden patterns and enhance machine learning predictions. The visualization highlights the increasing popularity of Neo4j as a platform for connected data, with a focus on its powerful capabilities and the impact it has on machine learning. The visualization shows a trend of increasing graph complexity as the number of vertices increases. odes and as edges) can thus yield impressive pre- dictive analytics and prescriptive analytics capabilities. Mark Needham and Amy Hodlers Graph Algorithms aims to broaden our knowledge and capabilities around these important types of graph analyses, including algo- rithms, concepts, and practical machine learning applications of the algorithms. From basic concepts to fundamental algorithms to processing platforms and practical use cases, the authors have compiled an instructive and illustrative guide to the won- derful world of graphs.

The top-ranked users (Chris, Lori, and Lonnie) have significantly more reviews than the lowest-ranked users (Leslie, Ben, and Rachel). The Bellagio algorithm, based on the Betweenness Centrality approach, appears to be effective in identifying new user types. The analysis also highlights the importance of real-time alerts for influencing users. The visualization shows that the Latvian users have a low average degree of connectivity, with only 4 million shortest paths between users. This is a significant finding, as it suggests a lack of strong social connections within the user community. The data also highlights the prevalence of superconnectors, with a small number of users connecting to many others. The average degree of connectivity is 0.5, which is significantly lower than the average of 4 million shortest paths. The visualization shows the top 50 users who have reviewed the Bellagio Hotel. It reveals that most users (between 50 and 100) have reviewed the hotel. The data also indicates that most users (betw m all nodes to a set of nodes called landmarks.
